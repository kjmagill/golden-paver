<!-- 
  This favicon SVG has been re-engineered for maximum clarity and browser compatibility.
  - The viewBox is enlarged to 120x120 to easily create a padded margin around the logo.
  - The logo shapes have been manually resized to create larger gaps (5 units vs. 3 units).
    This is critical for small sizes (16x16px), as it prevents the shapes from visually merging
    into a blurry blob, ensuring the logo's structure remains legible.
  - Complex transforms like `scale()` have been removed in favor of a simple `translate()`
    to improve rendering reliability.
