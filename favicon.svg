<!-- 
  This favicon has been optimized for sharpness at small sizes (e.g., 16x16).
  - A solid background rectangle provides high contrast and a defined shape.
  - Gaps are intentionally placed between the "paver" rectangles. This is crucial to prevent them
    from merging into a blurry blob at small resolutions, ensuring the logo shape remains distinct.
  - `shape-rendering="geometricPrecision"` hints to the browser to prioritize sharpness.
